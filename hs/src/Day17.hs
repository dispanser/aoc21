    - termination condidtion:
        - probe is past the rightmost x coordinate
        - probe is past the lowest y coordinate **and going down**
    - how do we restrict the search space?
        - it feels like x and y are completely independent:
        - x is dragged down by 1
        - y follows gravity
        - the choice of x can impact the choice of y:
          a different step could be the one "in range"
        - other than that, the y velocity could be super high,
          it just has to fit on its way down at the right step
        - when going down, the y coordinate (on the parable) is
          touching 0 again, after that continues to accelerate.
          so the upper limit is a step size of y' (min) because then
          it touches the lowest y of the boundary at the next step.
     - given target area: x=207..263, y=-115..-63
       - -115 is the accel, before that we have -114
       - solution is 114*115/2 == 6555
    - min x: x that barely reaches the lower x boundary (207),
      square function, ...
    - max x: the x that directly shoots to the rightmost x (207)
    - min y: directly shoot to the lower y bound
    - max y: see part1 solution
    - 200x200 -> 40k options, just simulate the trajectory, and
      terminate with "false" when going past the thing in either dir
